## 2026-05-18 - Blossom Upload Proxy Baseline

Question: after moving the public upload path from direct Worker/R2 writes to a Worker proxying a self-hosted hashtree origin, how much latency is visible to push clients?

Setup:
- Client generated a throwaway signing key for the run.
- Bodies were random encrypted-looking bytes.
- Target was the public upload Worker endpoint, through its configured origin proxy.
- Run used 12 concurrent `PUT /upload` requests per body size.
- No pubkeys, auth events, IPs, or content hashes were retained.

Results:

| Body size | Responses | Total wall time | Min | P50 | P95 | Max |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 1 KiB | 12 x 202 | 919 ms | 260 ms | 524 ms | 881 ms | 881 ms |
| 64 KiB | 12 x 202 | 698 ms | 243 ms | 476 ms | 676 ms | 676 ms |

Interpretation:
- The endpoint already returned `202 Accepted`, but the Worker waited for the origin server to accept the upload before responding.
- The likely client-visible cost was the Worker-to-origin hop plus origin validation and LMDB existence preflight, not the final LMDB body write.
- A safer optimization is to keep the origin as the backpressure point, acquire the bounded optimistic upload queue before responding, and avoid the LMDB existence preflight on the queued optimistic path.
- A Worker-only fire-and-forget mode should remain experimental because it can hide origin queue-full/storage failures from the pushing client.

Follow-up after moving the LMDB existence preflight behind bounded optimistic queue admission:

| Body size | Responses | Total wall time | Min | P50 | P95 | Max |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 1 KiB | 12 x 202 | 251 ms | 107 ms | 139 ms | 210 ms | 210 ms |
| 64 KiB | 12 x 202 | 178 ms | 112 ms | 134 ms | 157 ms | 157 ms |

Result:
- The p50 response time dropped from 524 ms to 139 ms for 1 KiB bodies and from 476 ms to 134 ms for 64 KiB bodies.
- The endpoint still answered only after the origin accepted each body into the bounded optimistic upload queue.
- A post-Worker-deploy smoke pass with 12 concurrent 1 KiB uploads returned 12 x 202 in 202 ms total, with 146 ms min, 148 ms p50, 168 ms p95, and 168 ms max.
